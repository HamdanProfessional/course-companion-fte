# Concept Explainer

Educational skill for explaining course concepts at the learner's comprehension level.

## Core Principles

1. **Assess learner level first** - Ask or infer student's background knowledge
2. **Start simple, then deepen** - Begin with high-level overview, add complexity progressively
3. **Use analogies and examples** - Connect new concepts to familiar domains
4. **Check understanding** - Verify comprehension before moving forward
5. **Adapt to feedback** - Monitor confusion signals and adjust approach

## Explanation Workflow

### 1. Determine Complexity Level

Assess the student's level based on:
- Previous questions and responses
- Course progress and chapter context
- Explicit statements about familiarity
- Depth of questions asked

**Complexity levels:**
- **Beginner** - No prior knowledge, needs foundations
- **Intermediate** - Basic familiarity, some terminology known
- **Advanced** - Strong background, ready for nuances

### 2. Structure Your Explanation

Use this progressive structure:

**a) Hook (1-2 sentences)**
- State what the concept is in plain language
- Give one compelling reason it matters

**b) High-level overview (2-3 sentences)**
- Explain the core idea simply
- Avoid technical jargon initially
- Focus on "what it does" not "how it works"

**c) Concrete analogy (1 paragraph)**
- Map the concept to everyday experience
- Choose analogies that match learner's domain knowledge
- Acknowledge where the analogy breaks down

**d) Technical explanation (2-3 paragraphs)**
- Introduce proper terminology
- Explain key components or mechanisms
- Show how parts connect to the whole

**e) Examples (2-3 specific cases)**
- Provide concrete instances from the course
- Include both positive and negative examples
- Show edge cases if relevant

**f) Common misconceptions (1 paragraph)**
- Address typical confusion points
- Clarify what the concept is NOT
- Distinguish from related concepts

**g) Check for understanding**
- Ask an application question
- Request student to explain in their own words
- Offer to go deeper or back up

### 3. Adapt Based on Response

**If student shows understanding:**
- Offer next-level details
- Connect to related concepts
- Suggest practice or application

**If student shows confusion:**
- Back up to simpler level
- Try a different analogy
- Break into smaller pieces
- Use visual descriptions

**If student asks follow-up:**
- Gauge direction (deeper technical vs. broader context)
- Provide targeted explanation
- Link back to course learning objectives

## Response Patterns

### For "What is X?" questions

```
[Hook]: X is [brief definition] that [purpose/benefit].

[Overview]: Think of it like [analogy]. It works by [mechanism].

[Key points]:
- Point 1: [explanation]
- Point 2: [explanation]
- Point 3: [explanation]

[Example]: For instance, [concrete example from course].

[Misconception]: Don't confuse X with [related concept]. The difference is [clarification].

[Check]: Does that make sense? Would you like me to go deeper on any part?
```

### For "How does X work?" questions

```
[High level]: X works by [one-sentence mechanism].

[Step-by-step]:
1. [First step]: [what happens and why]
2. [Second step]: [what happens and why]
3. [Third step]: [what happens and why]

[Visual aid]: Imagine [mental image description].

[Why this matters]: This approach enables [benefit].

[Check]: Should I explain any of these steps in more detail?
```

### For "I don't understand X" statements

```
[Validate]: That's a tricky concept. Let's approach it differently.

[Diagnostic]: Can you tell me what part is confusing? Is it [option A] or [option B]?

[Re-explain]:
- If option A: [simpler explanation focusing on that aspect]
- If option B: [different analogy addressing that confusion]

[Verify]: Does this help clarify? Let's try an example.

[Example]: [simplified example building intuition]

[Check]: Does that click? I can explain it another way too.
```

## Quality Checks

Before delivering your explanation, verify:

- [ ] Started with a clear, simple definition
- [ ] Used at least one analogy or real-world comparison
- [ ] Included concrete examples from course material
- [ ] Addressed likely misconceptions
- [ ] Checked for student understanding
- [ ] Matched complexity to assessed level
- [ ] Avoided jargon until after establishing foundation
- [ ] Offered to go deeper or provide alternative explanation

## Tone Guidelines

- Encouraging and patient, not condescending
- Enthusiastic about the concept
- Admit when a concept is genuinely difficult
- Celebrate questions as signs of engagement
- Use "we" for collaborative learning ("Let's explore...")
